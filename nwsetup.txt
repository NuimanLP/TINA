You have successfully installed TINA on the file server. To finish the network 
installation, you must run the setup program on each workstation (client) where 
you want to use Tina. Select the Run command from the Windows Start menu, enter 
the command U:\Tina Pro\NWSetup\NSETUP and follow the instructions. Note that 
Tina Pro is the main program directory holding Tina Pro on the server.

Notes: 

1) Before running NSETUP, make sure that in each client a mapped drive has been 
set to the network drive containing the Tina program directory (e.g., U:).

2) This special network version of TINA will only run if installed on a file server.
It will run on workstations where the setup with the NSETUP program has been already done.
