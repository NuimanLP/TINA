TINA Plus for Windows and TINA PRO 5.0 and 5.5 already in wide use =
throughout the world.

TINA Pro 6:

-Open several projects simultaneously and use copy and paste between projects

-Run analysis upon any open project

-New (.TSC) extension for project files to avoid collision with MS Schedule and Accel

-Store all analysis results (node and component voltages and currents) for post-processing

-Powerful post-processor for all analysis results

-XY-plot of any 2 transient or DC transfer results, for example v1(t) vs. v2(t) 

-Parameter stepping for any number of parameters

-Parameter stepping given by list

-Multiparameter optimization

-Draw lines, circles, arcs, and arrows in the schematic editor

-Add frame and title block to schematic diagrams

-Phasor diagram

-Voltage arrow to display voltages

-Diagonal lines for circuits such as bridges, delta, and wye (Y)

-Control switches with the keyboard via hotkeys

-Switch providing high and low logic levels directly

-Push button switches

-Fault insertion in wires

-Improved Library Manager for adding new models

-Improved method for changing component values in interactive mode with the mouse or 
 with the keyboard via hotkeys

-Control the display of component values and labels separately

-New components: VCO, BSIM 3.3, communication circuits, 74121, 74122, and much more
